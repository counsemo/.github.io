          <h3>Branch Out Final Report</h3>
      <p>I would like to update my final report that I did as an independent project in SMAD317.  I took this course my sophomore year and think there are multiple ways that I can update and add to my report in order to make it a stronger portfolio piece.</p>
      <p>The audience for my research are artists who are searching for collaborators.  These artists would most likely be recent graduates who are searching for a community or artists who have recently relocated and are looking for ways to plant their roots.</p>
